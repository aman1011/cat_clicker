		<p>    She walks in beauty</p>
		<p>Like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies</p>
		<p>and all that's best of Dark & Bright</p>
		<p>meet in her aspect & her eyes.</p>
		<p>Thus, mellowed to that thunder light</p>
		<p>which heaven to gaudy day denies,</p>
		<p>one shade the more, one ray the less</p>
		<p>had half impaired the nameless grace</p>
		<p>that waves in every raven tress</p>
		<p>or softly lighten o'er her face</p>
